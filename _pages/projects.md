# Universal Face Model

Advisor: [Prof. Fernando De la Torre](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YB8_6gkAAAAJ):

* Presented solutions for 3D Face Reconstruction from a single image & used StyleGAN to perform interactive face editing.
* Explored the use of Occupancy Networks to predict displacement maps and used ID-MRF loss to improve photo-realism.
* Project Website: https://mscvprojects.ri.cmu.edu/2022team3/

# MultiGAN Distillation

Advisor: [Prof. Deepak Pathak](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dpathak/):

* Analyzed training strategies for effective knowledge transfer from GANs to target domains with few images.
* Proposed solutions for data-efficient training of GANs and fusion of multiple pre-trained generators into one.

# Deep Product Search In the Wild

Advisor: [Mr. Balaji Krishnamurthy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/balaji-krishnamurthy-4241695)

* Worked on a deep learning based Visual Product Search which segments different products in a
wild image and performs search in a large catalogue.
* Proposed a novel grid based training of Siamese networks, allowing it to observe multiple positive and negative image instances simultaneously. The [research](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2019/papers/FFSS-USAD/Chopra_Powering_Robust_Fashion_Retrieval_With_Information_Rich_Feature_Embeddings_CVPRW_2019_paper.pdf) was awarded the [Best Paper Award](https://twitter.com/naverlabseurope/status/1140376555341795328) at CVPR 2019 Workshop on Fashion and Subjective Search.

# Automated Image Captioning using Multimodal Recurrent Nets

Advisor: [Prof. Poonam Goyal](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/poonam/profile)

* Designed an end to end model for generating sentence long descriptions of an input scene, using CNNs to extract image features and RNNs to decode them into natural language.
* Used Beam Search, Scheduled Sampling and Caption re-ranking strategies to improve the caption quality.
  
# Water Quality Analysis using Machine Learning Techniques

Advisor: [Dr. JL Raheja](https://www.ceeri.res.in/profiles/j-l-raheja/)

* Applied statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to monitor water quality from different water sources in India.
  
# Image Super Resolution using deep Convolutional Neural Networks

Advisor: [Prof. Surekha Bhanot](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Pilani/surekha/profile)

* Implemented a deep CNN from scratch to generate a higher quality/ detailed version of the low quality input image.
* The model outperformed the traditional heuristic based approaches on Timofte benchmark. The research was also presented in a paper at [APOGEE](https://www.bits-apogee.org/), BITS Pilani.
