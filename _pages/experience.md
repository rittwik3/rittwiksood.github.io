# Apple, Cupertino
<big> Machine Learning Intern (May'22 - Aug'22)</big> 
* Worked with the 3D Vision team at Apple Maps to detect road features like lane markings, sidewalks, bike paths, etc.
* Incorporated satellite imagery as a new data source to segment road features and update road network information.

# Adobe Systems, India

<big> Machine Learning Engineer-II (Jul'18 - Aug'21)</big> 

* Designed multiple network architectures to digitize print forms by extracting the hierarchical document structure.
* Proposed a high-resolution segmentation method to extract the form structure to up to four levels of granularity.
* Developed a service to directly transform print forms to responsive HTMLs for better viewing experience across devices.
* Utilised conditional GANs to generate synthetic training data corresponding to certain complex layout patterns.
* Scaled deep-learning workloads to TPU pods to achieve a 15x speedup in throughput and a 10x speedup in training time.
* Designed multi-modal solutions to leverage spatial and textual information in documents to further improve the form
structure extractor accuracy by 5%; deployed model to production.
* Focused on customer-oriented research to make print documents re-flowable by deploying several deep learning models in [AI Powered Automated Forms Conversion Service](https://www.adobe.com/in/marketing/experience-manager-forms/automated-forms-conversion.html).

# Media and Data Science Research Lab, Adobe India

<big> Computer Vision Research Intern (Jan’18 - Jul’18)</big> 

* Worked on a deep learning based Visual Product Search which segments different products in a wild image and performs search in a large catalogue.
* Proposed a novel grid based training of siamese networks, allowing it to observe multiple positive and negative image instances simultaneously. The [research](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2019/papers/FFSS-USAD/Chopra_Powering_Robust_Fashion_Retrieval_With_Information_Rich_Feature_Embeddings_CVPRW_2019_paper.pdf) was awarded the [Best Paper Award](https://twitter.com/naverlabseurope/status/1140376555341795328) at CVPR 2019 Workshop on Fashion and Subjective Search.
